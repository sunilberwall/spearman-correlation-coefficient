spearman correlation coefficient (data science)


it is only applicable for linear relation between x and y.

if p(x,y) =1 ,it is monotonic function

if p(x,y) =-1 ,it is opposite of monotonic.

if 1>p(x,y)<0 , then it is look like monotonic 

if -1<p(x,y)>0 ,then it is more look like not a monotonic function



p(x,y)= cov(x,y)/std(x).std(y)
